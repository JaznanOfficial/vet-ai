in this project, I'll use Next.js latest version 16. react-query for data fetching, caching and revalidating, shadcn for design (strict to this. always use shadcn components nothing else), vercel's ai sdk (use ai sdk own gateway like, https://vercel.com/ai-gateway ) for ai implementation. better auth for authentication. react-icons for icons. neondb with drizzle for db.
Don't write too much (more than 300 lines) code in a single file.
Always use small reusable components.
In every project, I'll have a workflow and coding style, like data fetching, caching etc, so follow the same structure and flow in all over the project.
Don't use multiple approach or system or style or pattern. for example, in a single project, don't use react-query and axios for data fetching. use only one for whole project. everything like this. follow 1 single structure and system.
